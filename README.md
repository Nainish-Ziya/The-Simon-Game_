ðŸš¨ **Flashback to the 90's!** ðŸš¨

I've recreated the iconic **Simon Game** using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery! ðŸŽ®âœ¨

For those who remember, Simon was the ultimate test of memory and reflexes. The game challenges you to follow an ever-growing sequence of lights and sounds. I've modernized it just enough to work smoothly in today's browsers, while keeping that nostalgic feel intact. 

Ready to test your memory? ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¡ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ Give it a try and see how far you can go!
